# Session Handoff: 2026-02-21

**Status:** Planstate-delivered grounded and designed (outline = design). Lifecycle terminology validated against SmartBear Collaborator, CI/CD, VSM. Single `lifecycle.md` approach adopted over marker files.

## Completed This Session

**Planstate delivered — grounding + design:**
- Grounded lifecycle terminology: 5 web searches, 2 page fetches, opus internal brainstorm (`plans/reports/lifecycle-terminology-grounding.md`, `plans/reports/ground-internal-lifecycle.md`)
- Two name changes: `defective` → `rework` (SmartBear/VSM precedent), `completed` → `reviewed` (cross-domain collision avoidance)
- Outline produced, reviewed twice (R1 marker-file version, R2 lifecycle.md version)
- Discussion: adopted single `lifecycle.md` (append-only) over 4 marker files — resolves review loop cycle without file deletion, provides audit trail
- Outline at `plans/planstate-delivered/outline.md` serves as design (7 decisions, 3 phases, all affected files identified)

## Pending Tasks

- [ ] **Planstate delivered status** — `/runbook plans/planstate-delivered/outline.md` | sonnet
  - Plan: planstate-delivered | Status: designed
  - Grounded lifecycle: `requirements → designed → planned → ready → review-pending → [rework ↔ review-pending] → reviewed → delivered`
  - Single `lifecycle.md` per plan (append-only, last entry = status) replaces 4 marker files
  - 3 phases: core inference (TDD), merge integration (TDD), skill/prose updates (general)

- [ ] **Merge artifact validation** — post-merge orphan detection in `_worktree merge` | sonnet
  - Plan: worktree-merge-resilience | Diagnostic: `plans/worktree-merge-resilience/diagnostic.md`
  - Pattern: in-place edits + tail divergence → git appends modified line as duplicate
  - Also: focused-session section stripping → content leaks into wrong section

- [ ] **Hook batch** — `/runbook plans/hook-batch/outline.md` | sonnet | restart
  - Absorbs: PostToolUse auto-format hook, SessionStart status hook
  - 5 phases: UserPromptSubmit (9 changes), PreToolUse recipe-redirect, PostToolUse auto-format, Session health (SessionStart + Stop fallback), Hook infrastructure (hooks.json + sync-to-parent merge)
  - Plan: hook-batch | Status: designed (outline complete)

- [ ] **Diagnose compression detail loss** — RCA against commit `0418cedb` | sonnet

- [ ] **Worktree CLI default** — Positional = task name, `--branch` = bare slug | `/runbook plans/worktree-cli-default/outline.md` | sonnet
  - Plan: worktree-cli-default | Status: designed
  - `--branch` creates worktree from existing branch (no session.md handling)
  - Scope expansion: Eliminate Worktree Tasks section, remove `_update_session_and_amend` ceremony, co-design with session.md validator
  - Absorbs: pre-merge untracked file fix (`new` leaves session.md untracked), worktree skill adhoc mode (covered by `--branch`), `--slug` override for `--task` mode (25-char slug limit vs prose task names)
  - `rm --confirm` gate: replace with merge-status check (is branch ancestor of HEAD?). Current gate provides no safety, gives wrong error message ("use wt merge" when user already merged), agent retries immediately with `--confirm`

- [ ] **SessionStart status hook** — Absorbed into Hook batch
- [ ] **PostToolUse auto-format hook** — Absorbed into Hook batch

- [ ] **Quality infrastructure reform** — `/design plans/quality-infrastructure/requirements.md` | opus
  - Plan: quality-infrastructure | Status: requirements
  - 4 FRs: deslop restructuring, code density, vet rename, code refactoring
  - Grounding: `plans/reports/code-density-grounding.md`
  - Subsumes: Rename vet agents (FR-3), Codebase quality sweep (FR-4)
  - Absorbs: integration-first-tests

- [ ] **Orchestrate evolution** — `/runbook plans/orchestrate-evolution/design.md` | sonnet
  - Design complete with Phase 1 (foundation) + Phase 2 (ping-pong TDD), ready for runbook planning
  - Insights input: ping-pong TDD agent pattern — alternating tester/implementer agents with mechanical RED/GREEN gates between handoffs. Tester holds spec context (can't mirror code structure), implementer holds codebase context (can't over-implement beyond test demands). Resume-based context preservation avoids startup cost per cycle

- [ ] **Session CLI tool** — `_session` group (handoff, status, commit) | sonnet
  - Plan: handoff-cli-tool | Status: designed
  - Combined outline at `plans/handoff-cli-tool/outline.md` (355 lines, 7 phases)
  - After pipeline fixes (done): outline review → sufficiency gate → `/runbook`
  - New requirement: commit subcommand must output shortened commit IDs (session scraping)

- [ ] **Deslop remaining skills** — Prose quality pass on skills not yet optimized (handoff, commit, opus-design-question, next done) | sonnet

## Worktree Tasks

(none)

## Blockers / Gotchas

**Never run `git merge` without sandbox bypass:**
- `git merge` without `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true` partially checks out files, hits sandbox, leaves 80+ orphaned untracked files

**`_update_session_and_amend` exit 128 during rm:**
- `_worktree rm` calls `_update_session_and_amend` → exit 128. Workaround: manual amend before `rm --confirm`

**`slug` and `--task` mutually exclusive in `_worktree new`:**
- Fix: worktree-cli-default adds `--branch` flag

**Merge resolution produces orphaned lines in append-only files:**
- When branch modifies existing entry in-place AND both sides add at tail, git appends modified line as duplicate. Focused-session section stripping causes content to leak into wrong section positions.
- Manual post-merge check required until worktree-merge-resilience automated

**Validator orphan entries not autofixable:**
- Marking headings structural (`.` prefix) causes non-autofixable error in `check_orphan_entries`

**Memory index `/how` operator mapping:**
- `/how X` → internally `"how to X"` — index keys must NOT include "to"

**Learnings at 170 lines — consolidation deferred:**
- Past 150-line trigger but 0 entries ≥7 active days. Aging required before graduation.

**Skill activation ~20% baseline:**
- Platform limitation — skill matching is pure LLM reasoning with no algorithmic routing. UserPromptSubmit hook with targeted patterns is the structural fix (hook batch Phase 1 items 8-9).

**SessionStart hook #10373 still open:**
- Output discarded for new interactive sessions. Stop hook fallback designed in hook batch Phase 4.

## Next Steps

Planstate delivered `/runbook` (outline = design, ready for planning). Hook batch `/runbook`. Session CLI tool `/runbook`.
