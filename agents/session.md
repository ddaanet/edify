# Session Handoff: 2026-02-24

**Status:** Validated merge integrity, 4 worktrees created, task-lifecycle designed and executed (planstate-derived commands + STATUS continuation).

## Completed This Session

- Prioritization report — 37 tasks scored via WSJF, report at `plans/reports/prioritization-2026-02-24.md`
  - Top 5: orchestrate evolution (5.3), session CLI tool (4.0, blocked), planstate delivered (3.8), session.md validator (2.6), WT merge session loss dx (2.6)
- Discussion: test sentinel versioning (rejected — local cache, not versionable)
- Merged `orchestrate-evolution` (×2) — 1st: recall skill tweak. 2nd: runbook planning (11 commits, design amendments + 4-phase runbook + execution artifacts)
- Merged `sentinel-copy` — `_worktree new` copies `tmp/.test-sentinel` to new worktrees
- Merged `planstate-delivered` — lifecycle implementation (TDD), deliverable review (0 Critical, 2 Major fixed), new bug tasks spawned
  - New tasks: execute orchestrate-evolution, fix prepare-runbook.py bugs, fix validate-runbook.py false positives, deliverable review auto-commit, fix when-resolve.py heading lookup
- Created `wt-merge-dirty-tree` worktree — bug: merge blocks on dirty worktree (should only check main)
- Post-merge validation: 4 merges checked, artifacts cleaned each time. Autostrategy still unreliable for session.md
- Designed recall tool anchoring (`plans/recall-tool-anchoring/`)
  - Gate inventory: 31 gates across 13 files, 61% prose-only (report: `plans/recall-tool-anchoring/reports/recall-gate-inventory.md`)
  - Outline through 3 discussion rounds: D+B hybrid application, reference manifest format, throwaway prototype
  - Key decisions: reference manifest forces tool-anchoring structurally (format requires resolution call); `_recall diff` anchors write-side gates; `_recall generate` deferred (entry selection is cognitive)
  - Recall artifact written with 11 entries from 6 decision files
- Merged `wt-merge-dirty-tree` — dirty-tree guard fix on main, worktree removed
- Designed task-classification (`plans/task-classification/`)
  - Feature 1: `/prime` skill — loads plan artifacts + chain-calls `/recall` for ad-hoc plan work outside workflow skills
  - Feature 2: Two-section task list — "In-tree Tasks" + "Worktree Tasks" (static planning signal, no move semantics)
  - Design evolution: @ref preload → SessionStart hook → scripted gate → all dropped → explicit `/prime` skill invocation
  - Key insight: @ref expansion and Read calls are cumulative (not deduplicated) — drove decision away from implicit injection
  - Outline reviewed by corrector: 0 critical, 3 major fixed, 3 minor fixed
- Validated merge integrity — wt-merge-dirty-tree (`50e37ede`) and planstate-delivered (`8a97fb71`), no session detail or learning loss
  - planstate-delivered merge: 5 `[from:]` artifacts appended to Blockers (cleaned in subsequent handoff `b571df3c`)
- Created 4 worktrees: recall-tool-anchoring, wt-merge-session-loss, when-resolve-fix, prepare-runbook-fixes
- Designed and executed task-lifecycle (`plans/task-lifecycle/`)
  - D: stale task commands in session.md after `/design` and `/runbook` advance plan
  - D: STATUS missing session-level continuation after direct skill execution
  - Three changes: (1) STATUS derives commands from planstate via CLI, (2) handoff carry-forward derives commands from `_NEXT_ACTION_TEMPLATES` mapping, (3) STATUS shows session continuation when tree dirty
  - Files: `execute-rule.md`, `handoff/SKILL.md`
  - Skill-reviewer caught 2 bugs: `designed` → wrong file (`outline.md` not `design.md`), `planned` → missing `agent-core/bin/` prefix. Fixed.

- [ ] **Worktree new fuzzy matching** — `_worktree new` accepts approximate task names instead of exact match | sonnet

## Worktree Tasks


- [ ] **Recall tool anchoring** → `recall-tool-anchoring` — `/design plans/recall-tool-anchoring/outline.md` | sonnet
  - Plan: recall-tool-anchoring | Status: designed (outline reviewed, ready for prototype)
  - Throwaway prototype: 3 shell scripts (check, resolve, diff) + D+B restructure of 8 skills/agents + PreToolUse hook
  - Reference manifest format: thin trigger list replaces content dump in recall-artifact.md

- [ ] **Worktree merge session loss diagnosis** → `wt-merge-session-loss` — RCA why `_worktree merge` autostrategy drops session.md context | sonnet
  - Root cause: focused session.md in branch lacks main's Worktree Tasks, autostrategy favors branch version
  - Observed: Merge 1 (`f525d705`) dropped WT entry, Merge 2 (`c91c7628`) left orphan + malformed blocker. Pre-merge: `0c91d969`
  - Observed: Merge 3 (`8a97fb71` planstate-delivered) appended 5 `[from: planstate-delivered]` entries into Blockers section. Merge 4 (`50e37ede` wt-merge-dirty-tree) clean — code-only branch, no session.md changes
  - Fix target: `src/claudeutils/worktree/merge.py` session autostrategy
  - Two manifestations: (1) WT Tasks entries dropped, (2) branch-only content appended to wrong section (Blockers)
  - Related: planstate-delivered (plan: planstate-delivered) would prevent "completed but no record" class

## Blockers / Gotchas

**Never run `git merge` without sandbox bypass:**
- `git merge` without `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true` partially checks out files, hits sandbox, leaves 80+ orphaned untracked files

**Merge resolution produces orphaned lines in append-only files:**
- When branch modifies existing entry in-place AND both sides add at tail, git appends modified line as duplicate.
- Manual post-merge check required until worktree-merge-resilience automated

**Validator orphan entries not autofixable:**
- Marking headings structural (`.` prefix) causes non-autofixable error in `check_orphan_entries`

**Memory index `/how` operator mapping:**
- `/how X` → internally `"how to X"` — index keys must NOT include "to"

**Learnings consolidated — 28 lines, 5 entries:**
- Next consolidation when entries age past 7 active days or file approaches 80-line soft limit.

**SessionStart hook #10373 still open:**
- Output discarded for new interactive sessions. Stop hook fallback deployed (Phase 4).

**`_worktree new` requires sandbox bypass:**
- Writes `.claude/settings.local.json` which is in sandbox deny list. Must use `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true`.

**Custom agents not discoverable as subagent_types:**
- `.claude/agents/*.md` files with proper frontmatter weren't available via Task tool. Built-in types work. May need platform investigation.

**`_worktree rm --force` doesn't restore task to Pending:**
- `rm --force` removes worktree but leaves task in Worktree Tasks section. Manual session.md edit needed to move back to Pending.

**`_worktree rm` fails on merge commits:**
- `_update_session_and_amend` calls `git commit --amend` which fails on merge commits (exit 128). Then `--force` can fail on submodule removal. Manual `rm -rf` of directory needed after.

**Orphaned remember-skill-update directory:**
- `/Users/david/code/claudeutils-wt/remember-skill-update` — git deregistered but directory remains. Needs manual removal.

**Worktree merge drops session.md Worktree Tasks entries:**
- Focused session in branch lacks main's full Worktree Tasks section. Autostrategy resolves in favor of branch, dropping main-only entries. Manual post-merge validation required until merge.py fixed.

**`just sync-to-parent` requires sandbox bypass:**
- Recipe removes and recreates symlinks in `.claude/` — sandbox blocks `rm` on those paths

## Next Steps

4 worktrees active (recall-tool-anchoring, wt-merge-session-loss, when-resolve-fix, prepare-runbook-fixes). Next: execute in worktrees, or task-classification runbook, or execute orchestrate-evolution on main.
