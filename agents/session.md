# Session Handoff: 2026-02-13

**Status:** TDD Cycles 1-5 complete (6 commits). All 24 validation tests passing. Precommit blocked on memory-index.md migration (Phase 9).

## Completed This Session

**TDD code fixes (Cycles 1-4):**
- Cycle 1 (e935321): `_extract_entry_key` includes operator prefix — `/when X` → "when x", `/how X` → "how to x"
- Cycle 2 (d11e279): Wire `operator` through `resolve()` signature — query includes operator for fuzzy matching
- Cycle 3 (80f744e): Wire operator from CLI to resolver — removed `# noqa: ARG001`, CLI passes operator
- Cycle 4 (2ade5c3): Extend section mode to H3+ headings — `_resolve_section` now matches all heading levels
- Cycle 5: Autofix function operator prefix handling — `_build_file_entries_map` now includes operator prefix in keys, matches `_extract_entry_key` logic

**Key insight (Cycle 5):**
- Headers dict keys include operator prefix (from heading text "When X")
- Entry dict keys include operator prefix (from `_extract_entry_key`)
- Structural set has NO operator prefix (just title text)
- Solution: Compare headers and entries directly (both have prefix), strip only for structural comparison

- [ ] **Commit skill optimizations** | sonnet
  - Blocked on: worktree-update delivery

## Blockers / Gotchas

**Autofix functions need updating:** `autofix_index` removes all entries instead of just structural ones. Root cause: autofix logic doesn't account for operator-prefixed keys. Need to strip operator prefix when comparing against structural set, but preserve full key for header matching.

**Precommit broken:** Phase 6 validator enforces /when format but Phase 9 migration not yet executed. 152+ entries fail `check_trigger_format`. Precommit will stay broken until migration completes. Currently 20/24 validation tests pass (4 autofix tests fail).

**Operator→prefix mapping:** `/when` → "When", `/how` → "How to". Both `_extract_entry_key` and `_build_heading` must use same mapping. Test both operators in every TDD cycle.

**Learnings.md over soft limit:** 319+ lines, consolidation blocked on memory redesign.

**Common context signal competition:** Structural issue in prepare-runbook.py. See `tmp/rca-common-context.md`.
