# Memory Index

Active knowledge retrieval. Invoke `/when` or `/how` to recall decisions.

**Invocation:**
/when <trigger>        # behavioral knowledge (when to do X)
/how <trigger>         # procedural knowledge (how to do X)

**Navigation:**
/when .Section Title   # section content by heading name
/when ..file.md        # entire decision file (relative to agents/decisions/)

**Consumption:** This index is loaded via CLAUDE.md @-reference. Do NOT re-read this file. Scan entries, invoke `/when` or `/how` for details.

**Append-only.** Do not index content already loaded via CLAUDE.md fragments.
