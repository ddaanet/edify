# Jobs

Plan lifecycle tracking. Updated when plans change status.

**Status:** `requirements` → `designed` → `planned` → `complete`

## Plans

| Plan | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| continuation-prepend | requirements | Problem statement only |
| error-handling | requirements | Outline complete, Phase B blocked on workflow improvements |
| feature-requests | requirements | GH issue research (sandbox, tool overrides) |
| orchestrate-evolution | designed | Design.md complete, vet in progress, planning next |
| parallel-orchestration | requirements | Deferred from orchestrate-evolution (worktree isolation needed) |
| plugin-migration | planned | Runbook assembled: 15 steps, haiku execution ready |
| reports | — | Shared reports directory (not a plan) |
| tweakcc | requirements | Local instances research |
| when-recall | complete | `/when` memory recall system — 12 phases, merged to main, 2 deliverable reviews |
| worktree-skill | complete | Design.md retained on disk for reference |
| worktree-update | complete | 40 TDD cycles, recovery (C2-C5), merged to main |
| worktree-merge-data-loss | complete | 13 TDD cycles + 1 general step, merged to main, deliverable review done |
| runbook-quality-gates | designed | Design complete, 2-phase delivery: Phase A prose edits, Phase B TDD scripts. 6 FRs, simplification agent + validate-runbook.py |
| workwoods | designed | Cross-tree worktree awareness, vet tracking, plan state inference, bidirectional merge |
| prototypes | requirements | Session extraction feature gap, multi-project scanning |
| remaining-workflow-items | complete | 5 FRs: reflect task output, tool-batching, delegate resume, agent output, commit simplification |
| remember-skill-update | requirements | Outline + requirements.md complete, Phase B discussion next |

## Complete (Archived)
