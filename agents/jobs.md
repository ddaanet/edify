# Jobs

Plan lifecycle tracking. Updated when plans change status.

**Status:** `requirements` → `designed` → `planned` → `complete`

## Plans

| Plan | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| continuation-prepend | requirements | Problem statement only |
| feature-requests | requirements | GH issue research (sandbox, tool overrides) |
| orchestrate-evolution | designed | Design.md complete, vet in progress, planning next |
| parallel-orchestration | requirements | Deferred from orchestrate-evolution (worktree isolation needed) |
| plugin-migration | planned | Runbook assembled: 15 steps, haiku execution ready |
| reports | — | Shared reports directory (not a plan) |
| tweakcc | requirements | Local instances research |
| when-recall | designed | `/when` memory recall system — design.md vetted, TDD runbook next |
| worktree-update | planned | Runbook complete: 40 TDD cycles (7 phases), reviewed and assembled, haiku execution ready |
