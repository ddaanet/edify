# Jobs

Plan lifecycle tracking. Updated when plans change status.

**Status:** `requirements` → `designed` → `planned` → `complete`

## Plans

| Plan | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| continuation-prepend | requirements | Problem statement only |
| feature-requests | requirements | GH issue research (sandbox, tool overrides) |
| orchestrate-evolution | designed | Design.md complete, vet in progress, planning next |
| parallel-orchestration | requirements | Deferred from orchestrate-evolution (worktree isolation needed) |
| plugin-migration | planned | Runbook assembled: 15 steps, haiku execution ready |
| reports | — | Shared reports directory (not a plan) |
| tweakcc | requirements | Local instances research |
| when-recall | complete | `/when` memory recall system — 42/42 TDD cycles, 8 phases, all checkpoints passed |
| worktree-fixes | requirements | Task name constraints, session merge blocks, merge commit fix (5 FRs) |
| workwoods | requirements | Cross-tree worktree awareness, vet tracking, plan state inference, bidirectional merge |
| pushback | requirements | Prevent yes-manning in design discussions |
| process-review | complete | RCA recovered to disk for workflow-improvements reference |
| workflow-fixes | complete | Unified /runbook skill, plan-reviewer agent, review-plan skill, pipeline-contracts |
| worktree-skill | complete | Design.md retained on disk for reference |
| worktree-update | complete | 40 TDD cycles, recovery (C2-C5), merged to main |

## Complete (Archived)

*41 plans completed and deleted. Git history preserves all designs/reports.*
