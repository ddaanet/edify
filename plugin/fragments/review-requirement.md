## Review Requirement

**Rule:** After creating any production artifact, delegate to `edify:corrector` for review and fix — unless the change qualifies as trivial (see Proportionality below).

### Proportionality

Not all changes warrant full review delegation. Match review cost to change risk.

**Self-review sufficient** when ALL conditions hold:
- ≤5 net lines changed (additions + deletions) across ≤2 files
- Change is additive or corrective (new bullet, typo fix, wording tweak)
- No control flow, data model, or contract changes
- No behavioral change to existing functionality

**Self-review process:** Run `git diff HEAD` to view changes. Verify correctness, consistency with surrounding content, and no unintended side effects. Proceed.

**Full review delegation required** when ANY condition holds:
- >5 net lines or >2 files changed
- Structural modification (rewriting logic, changing interfaces, altering behavior)
- New production artifact (not editing existing)
- Change affects contracts, data models, or control flow

**Why:** A 1-line bullet addition should not trigger a multi-turn agent delegation with execution context templates, report reading, and UNFIXABLE detection. Proportional review preserves quality without disproportionate overhead.

**Batch decomposition:** When multiple files change in one task, apply proportionality per-file, then route remaining files by artifact type. Do not collapse a batch into a single reviewer — the routing table is per-artifact-type, not per-batch.

**Production artifacts requiring review:**
- Plans (runbooks)
- Code (implementations, scripts)
- Tests
- Agent procedures
- Skill definitions
- Documentation that defines behavior or contracts

**Reviewer routing by artifact type:**

| Artifact | Reviewer | Why |
|----------|----------|-----|
| Code, tests, plans | `edify:corrector` | Default — general quality review |
| Skill definitions | `plugin-dev:skill-reviewer` | Cross-skill consistency (allowed-tools, conventions) |
| Agent definitions | `edify:corrector` | Agent structure, triggering, tool access — criteria from the `plugin-dev:agent-development` skill, named in the dispatch prompt |
| Design documents | `edify:design-corrector` (opus) | Architectural completeness and feasibility |

**Dispatch names are namespaced.** `subagent_type` requires `<plugin>:<agent>`; a bare name returns "Agent type not found", including for the dispatching plugin's own agents.

**When plugin-dev is not installed:** the skill-definition row falls back to `edify:corrector`, and the agent-definition row loses its criteria source — review against the agent definitions already in `plugin/agents/` instead. `plugin-dev` is a separate marketplace plugin, not an edify dependency — check availability before routing, and note the fallback in the review report so the weaker routing is visible.

Orchestration-specific extensions (planning artifacts, human docs): `docs/design.md` §6.4 "Pipeline contracts."

**Artifacts NOT requiring review:**
- Execution reports
- Diagnostic outputs
- Log files
- Temporary analysis
- Session handoffs (already reviewed during /handoff:handoff)

**Review process:**
1. Create artifact
2. Select reviewer from routing table above (default: `corrector`)
3. Delegate to selected reviewer with execution context (see below)
4. Read report, grep for UNFIXABLE (see detection protocol below)
5. If UNFIXABLE found: STOP, escalate to user
6. If all fixed: proceed

**Issue status taxonomy:** Four statuses (FIXED, DEFERRED, OUT-OF-SCOPE, UNFIXABLE) defined in detection protocol below. Only UNFIXABLE blocks — others are informational or non-blocking.

**No importance filtering.** The corrector applies all fixes (critical, major, minor). The caller does not triage or defer fixes.

**Why:** Early review catches issues before they propagate. Applying all fixes eliminates drift from deferred minor issues accumulating across sessions.

**Alignment verification:** Review must verify output matches design/requirements/acceptance criteria. This is not optional — review checks presence AND correctness.

**Model-agnostic:** Applies to haiku, sonnet, opus equally.

**Delegation requires specification:** If delegating implementation, provide criteria for alignment verification. Without criteria, executing agent cannot verify alignment, review cannot check drift.

**Reports exempt:** Reports ARE the verification artifacts.

### Execution Context

**Rule:** Every review delegation must include execution context — what was done, what state the system should be in, and what's in/out of scope.

**Why:** Review validates against current filesystem, not execution-time state. Without context, review may confabulate issues from future work, validate stale state, or miss drift from prior phases.

**Required context fields — must be structured lists, not empty prose. Fail loudly if any field is missing or contains only placeholder text.**
- **Scope IN:** Structured list of what was implemented/changed. Each item must name a concrete artifact (file, function, section). Grounds the review — without IN, review has no target.
- **Scope OUT:** Structured list of what is NOT yet implemented (future phases, deferred items). Each item must be specific enough to match against review findings. Prevents false positives — without OUT, review confabulates issues from future work.
- **Changed files:** Explicit file list (from `git diff --name-only` or known from implementation). Must not be empty.
- **Requirements summary:** What the implementation should satisfy (from design/requirements). Must reference specific FRs, acceptance criteria, or behavioral expectations.

**Anti-pattern:** Give corrector full design.md when reviewing phase checkpoint — agent may confabulate issues from future phases.

**Correct pattern:** Precommit-first grounds agent in real work; explicit IN/OUT scope prevents confabulating future-phase issues.

**Rationale:** Agent saw content in Phase 2 design, invented that test existed and claimed to fix it. Fix claims are dangerous (trusted by orchestrator), observations less so.

**Mitigations:** Precommit-first, explicit scope, "Do NOT flag items outside provided scope" constraint.

**Optional context fields (for phased work):**
- **Prior state:** What earlier phases established (dependencies, data models, interfaces)
- **Design reference:** Path to design document for alignment checking
- **Verification scope:** Files participating in cross-cutting invariants beyond the changed-files list. Include when design decisions specify cross-cutting constraints (D-N "all X must Y", NFR spanning multiple modules). Identify via grep for the invariant pattern across the full call graph. Omit for local, single-file requirements.

**Delegation template:**

Review [scope description].

**Scope:**
- IN:
  - [concrete artifact 1: file path, function name, or section heading]
  - [concrete artifact 2]
- OUT (do NOT flag these):
  - [specific future item 1 — e.g., "Phase 4 semantic propagation checklist"]
  - [specific future item 2 — e.g., "FR-17 execution feedback (deferred to wt/error-handling)"]

**Changed files:**
- [file1.md]
- [file2.md]

**Requirements:**
- [FR-N: specific requirement text or acceptance criterion]
- [FR-M: specific requirement text or acceptance criterion]

**Verification scope** (when cross-cutting invariants exist):
- [invariant: e.g., "all stderr output reaches user" — grep pattern: `err=True`]
- [files in invariant domain not in changed-files list]

**Constraints:**
- Do NOT flag items outside provided scope (scope OUT list)

Fix all issues. Write report to: [report-path]
Return filepath or error.

**Enforcement:** If a delegation prompt has empty IN, empty OUT, missing changed files, or missing Constraints section, the orchestrator must halt and populate the fields before delegating. An incomplete execution context produces unreliable review results — better to fail early than review against incomplete scope.

### UNFIXABLE Detection Protocol

**Rule:** After corrector returns, mechanically check for UNFIXABLE issues before proceeding.

**Four issue statuses:**
- **FIXED** — Fix applied, issue resolved. No action needed.
- **DEFERRED** — Real issue, explicitly out of scope. Item appears in scope OUT list or design documents it as future work. Informational only — does NOT block.
- **OUT-OF-SCOPE** — Not relevant to current review. Item falls outside the review's subject matter entirely — not a known deferral, just irrelevant. Does NOT block.
- **UNFIXABLE** — Technical blocker requiring user decision. All investigation gates passed, no fix path exists. Must include subcategory code (U-REQ, U-ARCH, U-DESIGN) and investigation summary.

**Full taxonomy reference:** `plugin/agents/corrector.md` (Status Taxonomy section with subcategory codes and investigation format).

**Detection steps:**
1. Read the report file returned by corrector
2. Use `rg` (Bash) to search for `UNFIXABLE` in the report content
3. If found: validate each UNFIXABLE issue (see validation below)
4. If validation fails: resume corrector for reclassification with guidance (delegate again with specific reclassification instructions in prompt — no continuation mechanism available)
5. If validated UNFIXABLE remains: **STOP**, report to user with report path, wait for guidance
6. If no UNFIXABLE found: proceed (DEFERRED and OUT-OF-SCOPE are non-blocking)

**UNFIXABLE validation (per issue):**
- Has subcategory code (U-REQ, U-ARCH, or U-DESIGN)
- Has investigation summary showing all 3 gates checked (scope OUT, design deferral, codebase patterns) with conclusion
- Does NOT overlap with scope OUT list (overlap → should be DEFERRED, not UNFIXABLE)
- If any check fails: resume corrector with specific reclassification guidance (e.g., "Issue X overlaps scope OUT — reclassify as DEFERRED" or "Issue Y missing investigation summary — complete 4-gate checklist or downgrade")

**DEFERRED is not UNFIXABLE.** DEFERRED items match the execution context OUT section — they are known future work, not blockers. Do not escalate DEFERRED items.

**OUT-OF-SCOPE is not DEFERRED.** OUT-OF-SCOPE items are unrelated to the review target. DEFERRED items are related but intentionally deferred. The distinction matters: DEFERRED items track known debt, OUT-OF-SCOPE items are noise.

**Why mechanical grep, not judgment:** Weak orchestrator pattern requires mechanical checks. UNFIXABLE detection is pattern-matching (grep), not evaluation — consistent with "trust agents, escalate failures."

**Anti-pattern:** Reading review report, seeing UNFIXABLE issues, and proceeding anyway because they "seem minor." ALL validated UNFIXABLE issues require user decision.

**Example:**
```
1. Create: plugin/agents/scout.md
2. Correction: Agent(subagent_type="edify:corrector") with execution context
3. Read report → grep UNFIXABLE → none found (DEFERRED items present but non-blocking)
4. Result: All fixable issues resolved, proceed
```
