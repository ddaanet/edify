### Phase C: Generate Design

**Objective:** Produce full design document, review, fix, commit.

#### C.1. Create Design Document

**Recall diff:** `Bash: recall diff <job-name>`

Review the changed files list. Approach commitment, revised scope, or rejected alternatives change which implementation and testing entries are relevant. If files changed that affect which recall entries are relevant, update the artifact: add entries surfaced by the discussion, remove entries for approaches that were rejected. Write updated artifact back.

**Output:** `plans/<job-name>/design.md`

**Content rules:** Read `references/design-content-rules.md` for content principles, density checkpoint, agent-name validation, classification table format, structure guidance, requirements section format, TDD additions, references/documentation perimeter sections, and skill-loading/execution model directives.

#### C.2. Checkpoint Commit

**Objective:** Commit the design document before review.

**Process:** Stage and commit `plans/<job-name>/design.md` (and any reports from Phase A).

**Why:** Preserves design state before review cycle. Enables diffing original vs post-review version. Isolates review changes in separate commit for audit trail.

#### C.3. Review Design

**CRITICAL: Delegate to design-corrector for review.**

Use Task tool with `subagent_type="design-corrector"`:

```
Review plans/<job-name>/design.md — Critical Design Review (CDR) criteria:
- Decisions fully specified (implementer needs no inference)
- Interfaces and integration points defined
- Agent/tool names verified against disk
- Test strategy or verification approach specified
- Late-added requirements re-validated
- Each major decision includes accepted tradeoffs

Include review-relevant entries from plans/<job-name>/recall-artifact.md if present (failure modes, quality anti-patterns).

Write detailed review to: plans/<job-name>/reports/design-review.md

Return only the filepath on success, or 'Error: [description]' on failure.
```

The design-corrector (opus model) performs comprehensive architectural review and writes a structured report with critical/major/minor issues categorized.

#### C.4. Check for Unfixable Issues

**Read the review report** from the filepath returned by design-corrector.

The design-corrector applies all fixes (critical, major, minor) directly. This step handles residual issues:

- **No UNFIXABLE issues:** Proceed to C.5.
- **UNFIXABLE issues found:** Address manually or escalate to user.

**Re-review if needed:** If user manually addresses UNFIXABLE issues, re-delegate to design-corrector for verification.

#### C.4.5. User Validation

Invoke `/proof plans/<job-name>/design.md` — structured validation loop on the completed design before routing to execution or /runbook. On terminal action "apply", /proof dispatches design-corrector automatically.

This is the user's first review of the full design document. The corrector review (C.3) checked mechanical quality; /proof validates design decisions and completeness with the user.

#### C.5. Execution Readiness and Handoff

`Read plans/<job>/design.md` — load the design to ground execution-readiness assessment.

Design can resolve complexity — a job correctly classified as Complex may produce Simple execution. Assess whether the completed design can be executed directly or needs runbook planning.

**Execution routing (work-type-aware):**

```
IF all prose edits, no implementation loops → direct execution
ELSE IF work type = Investigation → direct execution
ELSE IF work type = Exploration AND design resolved all questions → direct execution
ELSE (work type = Production AND behavioral code) → /runbook
```

**Direct execution criteria (all must hold for prose/investigation/exploration paths):**
- All decisions pre-resolved (no open questions requiring feedback)
- Insertion points or edit targets are identified (line-level or section-level)
- No cross-file coordination requiring sequencing
- No implementation loops (no test/build feedback required)
- Scope fits inline capacity (single session, single model)

Direct execution bypasses `/runbook` — this gate must assess both coordination complexity and capacity.

- **If execution-ready:** Follow §Continuation (prepends `/inline plans/<job> execute`).
- **If not execution-ready:** Commit design artifact, then follow §Continuation.

## Constraints

- High-capability model only (deep reasoning required)
- Delegate exploration (cost/context management)
- Dense output — omit obvious details planners can infer, focus on non-obvious decisions and constraints
- Design documents contain guidance (planners may adapt) and constraints (planners must follow literally). Classification tables are constraints.
