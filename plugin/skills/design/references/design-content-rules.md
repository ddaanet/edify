# Design Content Rules

Content principles and structure guidance for Phase C.1 design document generation.

## Content Principles

- Dense, not verbose -- downstream agents are intelligent
- Decisions with rationale, not just conclusions
- Concrete file paths and integration points
- Explicit scope boundaries (in/out)

## Decision Tradeoff Documentation

Each major architectural decision in design.md must include accepted tradeoffs — what the choice makes harder or more expensive, not just what it achieves. Follows ADR consequences pattern (Nygard 2011, Y-statement format).

Embed within each decision's rationale:
- **Decision:** [the choice]
- **Rationale:** [why this approach]
- **Accepted tradeoffs:** [what becomes harder, more expensive, or constrained]

Required for decisions affecting module boundaries, API contracts, execution model, or downstream workflow. Not required for routine implementation choices (variable names, standard patterns).

## Density Checkpoint

Before generating design, validate outline item granularity:
- **Too granular:** >8 items per phase, or adjacent items with <20 LOC delta each -- collapse into parent item or merge adjacents
- **Too coarse:** Single item handling >3 unrelated concerns or spanning multiple module boundaries -- split by concern
- **Heuristic:** items-per-phase x avg-LOC-per-item should fall in the 100-300 range. Below 100 suggests items are trivially small; above 300 suggests items are overloaded.
- Flag and fix before proceeding to design generation.

## Repetition Helper Prescription

When design specifies 5+ operations following the same pattern (e.g., "update field X in files A, B, C, D, E, F"), recommend extracting a helper function or script. Rationale: repeated manual operations multiply both token cost (each repetition consumes expansion + execution budget) and error rate (drift between repetitions increases with count). The 5-repetition threshold balances extraction overhead against repetition cost.

## Agent-Name Validation

Before finalizing design, verify all referenced agent names exist on disk:
- Glob `plugin/agents/*.md`, `.claude/agents/*.md`, and `.claude/plugins/*/agents/*.md`
- Every agent name in the design must resolve to an actual file
- If an agent name doesn't exist: flag as design error, not an implementation detail to defer
- Prevention: catches naming mismatches (e.g., `outline-corrector` vs `runbook-outline-corrector`) before they propagate to planning and execution

## Late-Addition Completeness Check

Requirements added after outline review (Phase B) must be re-validated before design generation:
- **Traceability:** Does the new requirement map to a specific outline item or design section?
- **Mechanism:** Does the new requirement specify a concrete implementation approach, not just a goal?
- If a late-added requirement lacks either: flag for completion before proceeding.
- Grounding: FR-18 added during a design session bypassed outline-level validation, resulting in a mechanism-free specification that downstream planners could not implement.

## Classification Tables Are Binding

When design includes classification tables (e.g., "X is type A, Y is type B"), these are LITERAL constraints for downstream planners/agents, not interpretable guidelines. Planners must pass classifications through verbatim to delegated agents.

Format classification tables with explicit scope:
- Default behavior (what happens without markers)
- Opt-out mechanism (how to deviate from default)
- Complete enumeration (all cases covered)

## Structure Guidance (adapt as needed)

- Problem statement
- Requirements (functional, non-functional, out of scope)
- Architecture/approach
- Key design decisions with rationale
- Implementation notes (affected files, testing strategy)
- References (see below)
- Documentation Perimeter (see below)
- Next steps

## Requirements Section Format

When requirements.md exists in job directory, include traceability mapping:

```markdown
## Requirements

**Source:** `plans/<job-name>/requirements.md` (or inline if documented during design)

**Functional:**
- FR-1: [requirement] -- addressed by [design decision/section]
- FR-2: [requirement] -- addressed by [design decision/section]

**Non-functional:**
- NFR-1: [requirement] -- addressed by [design decision/section]

**Out of scope:**
- [item] -- rationale
```

Each requirement should map to a design element for downstream validation.

## TDD Mode Additions

For designs with behavioral phases, include spike test strategy, confirmation markers for uncertain decisions, "what might already work" analysis. Reference the Diamond Shape integration-first strategy (defined in `/runbook` skill) -- note when integration-first ordering applies (external boundaries -> internal logic, not bottom-up by module).

## References Section

Track research artifacts and external references that informed the design. Backward-looking provenance (what shaped this design), distinct from Documentation Perimeter (forward-looking -- what the planner should read).

```markdown
## References

- `plans/<job-name>/reports/explore-<topic>.md` -- codebase exploration findings
- `plans/reports/<topic>.md` -- grounding research (if `/ground` invoked)
- [External Paper Title](url) -- informed decision D-3
- Context7: `/org/project` -- queried for hook configuration patterns
```

**Include when:** Any Phase A research produced reports, external sources were consulted, or `/ground` was invoked. Omit if design was based entirely on loaded internal documentation.

## Documentation Perimeter Section

Include this section specifying what the planner should read before starting:

```markdown
## Documentation Perimeter

**Required reading (planner must load before starting):**
- `agents/decisions/architecture.md` -- module patterns, path handling
- `plugin/fragments/delegation.md` -- quiet execution pattern
- `plans/{job-name}/reports/explore-{topic}.md` -- exploration results

**Context7 references:**
- `/anthropics/claude-code` -- hook configuration patterns (query: "PostToolUse hooks")

**Pipeline contracts:** `agents/decisions/pipeline-contracts.md` (for tasks producing runbooks)

**Additional research allowed:** Planner may do additional Context7 queries or exploration for technical implementation details not covered above.
```

**Rationale:** Designer has deepest understanding of what knowledge the task requires. Encoding this explicitly prevents planner from either under-reading (missing critical context) or over-reading (wasting tokens on irrelevant docs).

## Skill-Loading Directives

**Plugin-related topics (hooks, agents, skills, plugins):**
When the design involves Claude Code plugin components, include a skill-loading directive in "Next steps":
- Hooks -> `Load plugin-dev:hook-development before planning`
- Agents -> `Load plugin-dev:agent-development before planning`
- Skills -> `Load plugin-dev:skill-development before planning`
- Plugin structure -> `Load plugin-dev:plugin-structure before planning`
- MCP integration -> `Load plugin-dev:mcp-integration before planning`

This ensures the planner has domain-specific guidance loaded before creating the runbook.

## Execution Model Directives

When the design involves modifying workflow definitions (`agents/decisions/workflow-*.md`), skill files (`plugin/skills/`), or agent procedures (`plugin/agents/`), include an execution directive in "Next steps":
- Workflow/skill/agent edits: opus required

Ensures architectural artifacts get appropriate scrutiny during execution, not just planning.
