# TDD Workflow Guide

**Purpose:** Execute feature development using Test-Driven Development methodology.

## Overview

The TDD workflow implements the RED/GREEN/REFACTOR cycle for building features incrementally with test-first development. This workflow integrates with the general workflow through shared orchestration infrastructure while maintaining TDD-specific protocols.

### When to Use TDD Workflow

**Use TDD workflow when:**
- Project has test-first culture
- User mentions "test", "TDD", or "red/green"
- Feature requires behavioral verification
- Project is pytest-md or similar test-focused codebase

**Use general workflow instead when:**
- Infrastructure/migration work
- Refactoring without behavior change
- Prototype/exploration
- One-time fixes or cleanup tasks

### Integration with General Workflow

Both workflows share:
- `/design` skill (with mode-specific sections)
- `/orchestrate` execution engine (with runbook type detection)
- Review/correction process (corrector)
- Common orchestration patterns (weak orchestrator, standing agents dispatched with a step-file path)

**Key difference:** TDD uses cycles (RED/GREEN/REFACTOR) instead of generic steps.

### Methodology Detection Signals

The workflow automatically detects TDD methodology based on:

| TDD Signal | General Signal |
|------------|----------------|
| Project has test-first culture | Infrastructure/migration work |
| User mentions "test", "TDD", "red/green" | Refactoring without behavior change |
| Feature requires behavioral verification | Prototype/exploration |
| Project is pytest-md or similar | One-time fixes |

## Workflow Stages

The TDD workflow follows this progression:

```
/design (TDD mode) → /runbook → /orchestrate → [corrector] → edify:tdd-auditor
```

### Stage 1: Design Session (TDD Mode)

**Skill:** `/design`
**Model:** Opus

**Purpose:** Create architectural specification with TDD-specific spike test section.

**TDD mode additions to design document:**
- **Spike Test section** - Verify current behavior, document framework defaults
- **`(REQUIRES CONFIRMATION)` markers** - Flag decisions needing user input
- **Flag reference table** - If adding CLI options
- **"What might already work" analysis** - Identify existing behavior

**Output:** Design document with TDD-specific sections consumed by `/runbook`.

---

### Stage 2: TDD Planning

**Skill:** `/runbook`
**Model:** Sonnet
**Documentation:** `plugin/skills/runbook/SKILL.md`

**Purpose:** Create TDD runbook with RED/GREEN/REFACTOR cycles from design document.

**Process:**
1. Read design document (from /design TDD mode)
2. Analyze feature requirements and design decisions
3. Decompose into atomic behavioral increments
4. Generate RED/GREEN specifications per cycle
5. Create draft runbook at `plans/<feature-name>/runbook.md`
6. **Delegate to clean sonnet agent for runbook review:**
   - Completeness: All features from design covered
   - Executability: Clear, actionable instructions
   - Context sufficiency: Adequate information for isolated execution
   - Test sequencing: Ensures new tests will RED (fail) before GREEN
   - Implementation hints: Provides sequencing guidance if needed for correct test behavior
7. Apply review feedback to runbook
8. Final runbook ready for preparation

**Next step:** Run `prepare-runbook.py` to generate execution artifacts.

**Runbook structure:**
```markdown
---
name: feature-name
type: tdd
model: haiku
---

## Weak Orchestrator Metadata
- Runbook Type: TDD
- Total Cycles: N
- Execution Model: Haiku (test-driver agent)
- Error Escalation: Haiku → Sonnet → User
- Report Locations: plans/<name>/reports/

## Common Context
[Shared knowledge for all cycles - design decisions, file paths, conventions]

## Cycle X.Y: [Description]

**Dependencies**: [Previous cycles or none]

### RED Phase
**Test**: [Test name and location]
**Assertions**: [Expected test assertions]
**Expected Failure**: [Exact failure message]

### GREEN Phase
**Implementation**: [Minimal implementation description]
**Files**: [Files to modify]
**Minimal**: [Guidance on minimal approach]

### Stop Conditions
- If RED passes unexpectedly: [Action]
- If GREEN fails after 2 attempts: [Action]
```

**Output:** Reviewed TDD runbook at `plans/<feature-name>/runbook.md`

**Review completed:** /runbook automatically delegates review to runbook-corrector agent before finalization.

**After /runbook (runbook reviewed and finalized), run prepare-runbook.py:**
```bash
python3 plugin/bin/prepare-runbook.py plans/<feature-name>/runbook.md
```

This generates:
- `plans/<feature-name>/steps/step-{X}-{Y}-test.md` and `-impl.md` (RED and GREEN halves of each cycle)
- `plans/<feature-name>/common-context.md` (shared context and resolved recall)
- `plans/<feature-name>/orchestrator-plan.md` (execution index and phase-agent mapping)

---

### Stage 3: TDD Execution

**Skill:** `/orchestrate`
**Model:** Haiku (weak orchestrator)

**Purpose:** Execute TDD cycles using the standing `edify:test-driver` agent.

**Execution pattern:**
1. `prepare-runbook.py` writes a step file per cycle half, each carrying a `## Context` block naming the design, outline, and `common-context.md`
2. Orchestrator dispatches `edify:test-driver` with the step-file path — tester and implementer are two named instances of the same agent type
3. Agent reads the named artifacts, then executes the RED or GREEN protocol
4. Structured log written to execution report

**Why context reaches the agent through files:**
- Each cycle half gets fresh context (no accumulation)
- Scope is enforced structurally — the agent sees one step file, not the runbook
- Nothing is installed into `.claude/agents/`, so no session restart sits between planning and execution

---

### Stage 4: Review

**Agent:** corrector
**Model:** Sonnet

**Purpose:** Review uncommitted changes before finalization.

**Scope:** All uncommitted changes from TDD execution.

**Activities:**
- Delegate to corrector (orchestrator has no implementation context)
- Agent reviews all changes and applies critical/major fixes directly
- Agent writes detailed report with FIXED/UNFIXABLE status per issue

**Post-review:**
- Check report for UNFIXABLE critical/major issues → escalate to user
- Minor issues → Document for future

---

### Stage 5: TDD Process Review

**Agent:** `edify:tdd-auditor`
**Model:** Sonnet

**Purpose:** Assess TDD compliance and process quality.

**Activities:**
- Compare planned cycles vs actual execution
- Assess adherence to RED/GREEN/REFACTOR protocol
- Identify process improvements
- Produce recommendations

**Future:** Uses edify session extraction when available.

---

## TDD Cycle Structure

Each cycle follows strict RED/GREEN/REFACTOR protocol.

### RED Phase Protocol

**Objective:** Write failing test that specifies desired behavior.

**Steps:**
1. Write test exactly as specified in cycle definition
2. Run `just test` to execute test suite
3. Verify failure matches expected message from cycle spec
4. If test passes unexpectedly:
   - Check for `[REGRESSION]` marker in cycle spec
   - If not marked regression → STOP and report

**Success criteria:** Test fails with expected error message.

**Stop condition:** Unexpected pass (unless `[REGRESSION]` marker present).

---

### GREEN Phase Protocol

**Objective:** Write minimal implementation to make test pass.

**Steps:**
1. Write minimal implementation per cycle guidance
2. Run `just test` to verify new test passes
3. Run full test suite to check for regressions
4. Handle regressions individually (never batch multiple regression fixes)
5. If stuck after 2 attempts → STOP, mark BLOCKED, await guidance

**Success criteria:** New test passes, full suite passes (no regressions).

**Stop condition:** Unable to make test pass after 2 attempts.

---

### REFACTOR Phase Protocol (Mandatory)

**Objective:** Improve code quality while maintaining green tests.

**This phase is mandatory for every cycle** to ensure code quality is maintained throughout development.

**Step 1: Format & Lint**
```bash
just lint  # includes reformatting
```
Fix lint errors. Ignore complexity warnings and line limits (addressed in next steps).

**Step 2: Intermediate Commit (Rollback Point)**
```bash
git commit -m "WIP: Cycle X.Y [name]"
```
Creates rollback point before refactoring.

**Step 3: Quality Check**
```bash
just precommit  # validates green state BEFORE refactoring
```
Surfaces complexity warnings and line limit issues.

**Step 4: Refactoring Assessment (if warnings present)**

Determine appropriate handler based on warning type:

| Warning Type | Handler |
|--------------|---------|
| Common patterns (split module, simplify function) | Sonnet designs and executes |
| Architectural (new abstraction, multi-module impact) | Opus designs, decides escalation |
| New abstraction introduced | Opus, always escalate to human |

**Step 5: Execute Refactoring (if needed)**

See Refactoring Tiers section below for execution approach.

**Step 6: Post-Refactoring Updates (if code moved/renamed)**

Update all references to refactored code:
1. **Plans** - All designs and runbooks (`grep -r "old_ref" plans/`)
2. **Agent documentation** - Files in `agents/` (architecture, patterns, implementation)
3. **CLAUDE.md** - Only if behavioral rules affected (keep focused on behavior)
4. **Regenerate step files** - If runbook.md changed, re-run `prepare-runbook.py`

Verification: Use `grep` to confirm old references are gone.

**Step 7: Amend Commit**

Safety check before amending:
```bash
current_msg=$(git log -1 --format=%s)
if [[ "$current_msg" != WIP:* ]]; then
  echo "ERROR: Expected WIP commit, found: $current_msg"
  exit 1
fi
```

Amend and reword:
```bash
git commit --amend -m "Cycle X.Y: [name]"
```

**Goal:** Only precommit-validated states in commit history.

## Refactoring Tiers

When quality checks identify issues requiring refactoring, use tiered approach:

### Tier 1: Script-Based Refactoring

**Criteria:**
- Mechanical transformation
- Single pattern application
- No design judgment required

**Examples:**
- Split module by moving classes to new files
- Extract repeated code into helper function
- Rename variables for consistency

**Execution:**
- Sonnet writes transformation script
- Execute script directly (no orchestrator needed)
- Verify with `just precommit` after execution

**Why skip orchestrator:** Script-based refactoring is mechanical and verified by precommit. Orchestrator overhead not justified.

---

### Tier 2: Simple Runbook

**Criteria:**
- 2-5 steps required
- Minor design judgment needed
- Localized changes

**Examples:**
- Simplify complex function with multiple techniques
- Reorganize module structure with dependencies
- Extract and test new utility function

**Execution:**
- Create inline step list in cycle report
- Execute steps sequentially without prepare-runbook.py
- Verify with `just precommit` after completion

---

### Tier 3: Full Runbook

**Criteria:**
- 5+ steps required
- Design decisions embedded in execution
- Cross-cutting changes

**Examples:**
- Introduce new architectural abstraction
- Refactor multi-module subsystem
- Major restructuring with broad impact

**Execution:**
- Run `prepare-runbook.py` to create runbook artifacts
- Execute via `/orchestrate` with full orchestration
- Treat as nested runbook within TDD execution

**Note:** Tier 3 refactoring is rare. Most TDD refactoring is Tier 1 or 2.

---

## Commit Strategy

The TDD workflow uses WIP commits as rollback points with post-refactoring amends.

### Commit Flow Per Cycle

1. **After GREEN passes:** Create WIP commit
   ```bash
   git commit -m "WIP: Cycle X.Y [name]"
   ```

2. **Execute REFACTOR phase:** Lint, quality check, refactoring (if needed)

3. **Verify precommit passes:** Ensure all tests and checks pass

4. **Amend WIP commit:** Replace WIP with final message
   ```bash
   git commit --amend -m "Cycle X.Y: [name]"
   ```

### Safety Checks Before Amend

**Always verify WIP commit exists:**
```bash
current_msg=$(git log -1 --format=%s)
if [[ "$current_msg" != WIP:* ]]; then
  echo "ERROR: Expected WIP commit, found: $current_msg"
  exit 1
fi
```

### Rationale

- **Rollback safety:** WIP commit provides known-good state
- **Clean history:** Only precommit-validated states in commit history
- **Refactoring confidence:** Can reset to WIP if refactoring breaks tests

## Command Reference

Test and quality check commands used throughout TDD workflow:

| Command | Purpose | Used In |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `just test` | Run test suite | RED/GREEN phases |
| `just lint` | Lint + reformat code | REFACTOR phase (post-GREEN) |
| `just precommit` | Check + test (no reformat) | REFACTOR phase (validate before/after refactoring) |

**Note:** These are hardcoded initially. Project-specific configuration is TODO.

### Command Details

**`just test`**
- Runs test suite (typically pytest)
- Used to verify RED (expect failure) and GREEN (expect pass)
- Single test or full suite depending on phase

**`just lint`**
- Runs linter (ruff, pylint, etc.)
- Reformats code automatically
- Used immediately after GREEN to clean up formatting

**`just precommit`**
- Runs all checks without reformatting
- Includes: lint checks, complexity warnings, line limits, tests
- Used before and after refactoring to validate quality

---

## Stop Conditions and Escalation

### Stop Conditions

Agent stops and reports when encountering:

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| RED passes unexpectedly (no `[REGRESSION]` marker) | STOP - Investigate why test passes |
| GREEN fails after 2 attempts | STOP - Mark BLOCKED, await guidance |
| Refactoring breaks tests | STOP - Keep state for diagnostic (no auto-reset) |
| Architectural refactoring detected | Escalate to Opus (Opus decides human escalation) |
| New abstraction introduced | Always escalate to human for approval |

### Escalation Chain

| Result | Action |
|--------|--------|
| `success` | Proceed to next cycle |
| `quality-check: warnings found` | Escalate to Sonnet for refactoring design |
| `architectural-refactoring` | Escalate to Opus (Opus decides human escalation) |
| `blocked: [reason]` | Standard escalation (Sonnet → User) |
| `error: [details]` | Standard escalation |
| `refactoring-failed` | STOP - Write diagnostic report, keep state |

## Integration Points

### Differences from General Workflow

| Aspect | General Workflow | TDD Workflow |
|--------|------------------|--------------|
| **Unit of work** | Steps | Cycles (RED/GREEN/REFACTOR) |
| **Planning skill** | `/runbook` | `/runbook` |
| **Baseline agent** | `artisan.md` | `test-driver.md` |
| **Execution focus** | Sequential steps | Test-first development |
| **Refactoring** | Optional | Mandatory per cycle |
| **Commit strategy** | Per step or milestone | WIP + amend per cycle |
| **Post-execution** | corrector | corrector + `edify:tdd-auditor` |

### When to Use Each Workflow

**Use TDD workflow for:**
- Feature development requiring tests
- Projects with test-first culture
- Behavioral verification needed
- Incremental feature building

**Use general workflow for:**
- Infrastructure setup
- Data migrations
- Refactoring existing code
- One-time fixes
- Prototypes/exploration

### Transition Between Workflows

**From TDD to General:**
- Complete TDD execution and process review
- Switch to general workflow for infrastructure/migration work
- Use `/design` to start new task

**From General to TDD:**
- Complete general workflow execution and review
- Switch to TDD for feature development
- Use `/design` (auto-detects TDD methodology)

## Structured Log Entry

After each cycle, test-driver agent appends to execution report:

```markdown
### Cycle X.Y: [name] [timestamp]
- Status: RED_VERIFIED | GREEN_VERIFIED | STOP_CONDITION | REGRESSION
- Test command: `[exact command]`
- RED result: [FAIL as expected | PASS unexpected | N/A]
- GREEN result: [PASS | FAIL - reason]
- Regression check: [N/N passed | failures]
- Refactoring: [none | description]
- Files modified: [list]
- Stop condition: [none | description]
- Decision made: [none | description]
```

This structured format enables:
- Process review analysis
- Debugging failed cycles
- TDD compliance assessment
- Progress tracking across sessions
